RequireJS Boilerplate web app setup
===================================

A very minimal setup that allows you to get started writing a web application in a very productive environment as quickly
as possible.

This originated as a directory that I would manually copy over for new projects. I hope someone else finds it useful.

 * RequireJS : http://requirejs.org/
 * RequireJS Plugins : cs, text, order, domReady, i18n,
 * Underscore : http://underscorejs.org/
 * jQuery : http://jquery.com
 * LessCSS : http://lesscss.org/
 * Bootstrap CSS : http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

I take no credit for any of these libraries. Nothing substantial in this repository is mine, it's just a compilation
of great libraries that I use often.

Bugs?
-----

There may be. Since this started as a very informal boilerplate setup for myself I may have tweaks or fixes made since this version
that I've forgotten to include, so let me know of any issues and I will get them in here.
